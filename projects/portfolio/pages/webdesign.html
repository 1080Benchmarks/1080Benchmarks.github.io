      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I began designing websites in the summer of 2016. Since then I've learned the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, and I am currently learning Javascript. Right now my main goal is to continue creating unique and user friendly websites to the best of my ability. In the eight months or so I have been taking web design seriously I've created a ton of websites which you can view below.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>When designing websites I find it really important to not only create something that fulfills its task, but also create something unique that has never been seen before. However, that doesn't mean I don't take inspiration from other peoples works. Before I started designing websites I was and still am very interested in graphic design. I created logos, social banners, advertisements all of which have had an impact on how I now design websites. Some noteable catalysts for my style in design are: <span>SesoHQ</span> (A graphic designer youtuber), <span>Vexx</span> (An artist youtuber), and <span>Garret Malone</span>. I am also inspired by tons of random people across the internet, who have made my work how it is. </p>
