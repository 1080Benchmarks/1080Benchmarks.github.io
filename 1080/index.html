          <p>Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake.
    Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.
    It was a dog. It was a big dog.
    Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe. What brings you out of the prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?
    Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence, this cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening, I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca. I had this fantasy, that I would look across the tables and I would see you there with a wife maybe a couple of kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, nor me to you. But we would both know that you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you than that. I still do.
    To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?
    If you're good at something, never do it for free.
    I'm Batman
    Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you.
    You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.
    I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world.
    I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.
    I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?</p>
